# FACN3 Projects

## What
A repository to keep record of facn3's project ideas.

## Why
For easier collaboration and visibility.

## How
- If you wish to propose an idea, follow these steps:
  - raise an issue
  - in the issue, explain the problem you're trying to solve
  - describe the solution you thought of
  - mention your user-base/target-audience
  - if there are any technologies that you believe you should use for the project, add them too
  - label it with the corresponding label (`internal-project`/`client-project`)
- If you wish to work on a project which has been proposed, assign yourself to the issue that has been raised
- Any project with a 2-4 people assigned to it is a viable one, any project with less than 4 people is considered to have a vacant spot
- You can switch to a different project by un-assigning yourself from one and assigning yourself to the other
